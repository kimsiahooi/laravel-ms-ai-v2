/**
 * What the Columns panel does to a set of column definitions, as pure functions.
 *
 * Beside `table.ts` rather than in `lib/`, for the same reason `table.ts` is: it is the
 * table's own vocabulary, and it needs {@see ColumnMeta}. `lib/` reaching into
 * `components/` would run the dependency arrow backwards — the rule that matters more
 * here than "pure code lives in lib/", which this file satisfies anyway. Nothing in it
 * imports React.
 *
 * **The central idea is the anchor.** A column with a `meta.label` is configurable: the
 * reader can hide it and move it. A column without one is an anchor — always rendered,
 * and always at the index where it was declared. Row actions are the anchor that exists
 * today; a future select-checkbox column would be one at the *other* end, which is why
 * anchors are re-inserted at their declared index rather than pushed to the back.
