/**
 * What a list shows when it has no rows — which is three different situations wearing the
 * same shape, and they need different answers.
 *
 * 1. **Nothing matched.** A search, a filter, or both. The way out is to undo whichever
 *    one is in force, so the buttons are offered one per thing rather than as a single
 *    compound label that would have to describe every combination.
 * 2. **Nothing on this page.** A real state, not a theoretical one: delete the last row of
 *    the last page and the redirect carries `?page=N` to a page that no longer exists.
 *    (v1 showed "no results match ''" here, quoting a search nobody made.)
 * 3. **Nothing at all**, which is the resource's own copy — only this one knows whether an
 *    empty list means "add your first supplier" or "set up a warehouse first".
 *
 * `narrowed` and `searching` are derived here rather than passed, because both are just
 * readings of `search` and `filter.count` and a second copy could disagree with the one
 * the table uses to decide whether to render a toolbar at all.
