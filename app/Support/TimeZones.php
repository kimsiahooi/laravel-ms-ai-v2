 * string on the wire. This class only decides how those instants are *displayed*, and
 * it exists for one reason: the server has to know the viewer's zone before it
 * renders, because under SSR the same markup is produced twice — once in PHP's Node
 * process and once in the browser — and a zone the browser decides for itself would
 * make those two disagree. That is a React #418 hydration mismatch, which is exactly
 * the trap {@see Locales} avoids by refusing to read `navigator.language`.
 *
 * So the browser reports its zone into a cookie (the inline script in `app.blade.php`,
 * beside the one that applies dark mode before first paint), and this reads it back.
 * The client is then told what the server used, and both format against that one
 * string. Nothing anywhere calls `resolvedOptions()` during a render.
 *
 * An IANA identifier rather than a numeric offset, because an offset is only correct
 * until the next daylight-saving change. `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur` has none; `America/New_York`
 * is -05:00 in December and -04:00 in June, and only the name knows that.
