/**
 * Validation parity gate — the replacement for the deleted parity test.
 *
 * The zod schemas exist to refuse, in the browser, exactly what the server refuses.
 * That only holds while the two lists of fields agree, so this reads the real PHP
 * FormRequests and checks that every field the server validates is one the browser
 * knows about too.
 *
 * Deliberately field-level, not rule-level: pinning every rule string would break on
 * harmless rewording, while a *missing field* is the failure that actually matters —
 * it means a value reaches the server unchecked.
 *
 * Schemas are discovered by convention, so adding a resource needs no edit here:
 *
 *     app/Http/Requests/Tenant/CategoryRequest.php
 *       → resources/js/lib/validation/schemas/category.ts   (export `categorySchema`)
 *
 * A schema exported as a factory (it needs runtime options, e.g. the allowed
 * currencies) is listed in FACTORY_ARGS below with the arguments to build it with.
 *
 * Run: `bun run check:validation`
