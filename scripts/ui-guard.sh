# UI / code-standards guard, run by the lefthook pre-commit hook. Enforces the
# mechanical parts of the project's standards so nothing lands that breaks them:
#
#   1. No edits to vendored / generated (read-only) trees — wrap or compose instead
#      of forking shadcn `ui/**` (see docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md).
#   2. No raw colour literals (#hex / rgb() / hsl()) or inline colour styles in TSX —
#      everything goes through the design tokens (docs/UI-UX-GUIDELINES.md).
#      Escape hatches: a `data:` URI, or a `ui-allow` comment on the line.
#   3. No nondeterministic values in render output — a React #418 hydration mismatch.
#
# This project runs SSR and has NO test suite, so a hydration mismatch would
# otherwise only surface by eye. Rule 3 is the cheapest guard against that.
#
# `resources/css/app.css` is deliberately NOT read-only: it holds the authored design
# tokens. It is excluded from Biome only because Biome cannot parse Tailwind v4
# at-rules (@theme, @utility) — that is a formatting limitation, not a vendored tree.

#
# `resources/js/types/generated.d.ts` was listed here and has been removed. It is
# generated but COMMITTED, so it is supposed to change in commits — every regeneration
# would have tripped this and the only way past would have been to skip the hook. It is
# guarded the way its twin `lang.d.ts` is instead: `bun run check:generated-types`
# fails if it does not match what `app/Data` would produce, which catches the stale file
# AND the hand-edit, rather than blocking the legitimate case.
