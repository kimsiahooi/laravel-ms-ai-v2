/**
 * Generated-types gate — the counterpart to check-i18n.ts's staleness check.
 *
 * `resources/js/types/generated.d.ts` is produced from `app/Data/**` and committed, so
 * it can be wrong in two ways that nothing else notices:
 *
 *   1. **Stale.** A Data class gained, lost or renamed a property and nobody re-ran
 *      `bun run types:generate`. TypeScript then type-checks the pages against a wire
 *      shape the server stopped sending — green build, wrong app. This is precisely the
 *      drift the DTO layer exists to prevent, so leaving it unguarded would defeat the
 *      point of having one.
 *   2. **Hand-edited.** Someone patched a field into the file directly. The next
 *      regeneration silently reverts it, which is a confusing way to lose an afternoon.
 *
 * A single comparison catches both: transform into a temp directory and diff. The temp
 * directory is not incidental — a staleness check that writes where it is checking
 * leaves a modified tree behind when it fails, and the *next* run then reports
 * staleness for a reason that has nothing to do with the change under test. That
 * happened once already with the i18n gate; see docs/MIGRATION-STATUS.md.
 *
 * Run: `bun run check:generated-types`
